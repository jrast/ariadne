Modularization
==============

Ariadne allows you to spread your GraphQL API implementation over multiple files, with different strategies being available for schema and resolvers.

Internally Ariadne uses special function named ``make_executable_schema`` for GraphQL server creation. This function is called by all other code that creates GraphQL servers, with values of ``type_defs`` and ``resolvers``. Following guides apply for all Ariadne functions and classes that take those arguments.


Defining schema in ``.graphql`` files
-------------------------------------

Recommended way to define schema is by using the ``.graphql`` files. This approach offers certain advantages:

- First class support from developer tools like `Apollo GraphQL plugin <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=apollographql.vscode-apollo>`_ for VS Code.
- Easier cooperation and sharing of schema design between frontend and backend developers.
- Dropping whatever python boilerplate code was used for SDL strings.

To load schema from file or directory, you can use the ``load_schema_from_path`` utility provided by the Ariadne::

    from ariadne import load_schema_from_path, start_simple_server

    # Load schema from file...
    type_defs = load_schema_from_path("/path/to/schema.graphql")

    # ...or construct schema from all *.graphql files in directory
    type_defs = load_schema_from_path("/path/to/schema/")

    # build an executable schema
    schema = make_executable_schema(type_defs)

    # Start server that can't execute any queries, but allows you to browse your schema
    start_simple_server(schema)

``load_schema_from_path`` validates syntax of every loaded file, and will raise an ``ariadne.exceptions.GraphQLFileSyntaxError`` if file syntax is found to be invalid.


Defining schema in multiple modules
-----------------------------------

Because Ariadne expects ``type_defs`` to be either string or list of strings, it's easy to split types across many string variables in many modules::

    query = """
        type Query {
            users: [User]!
        }
    """

    user = """
        type User {
            id: ID!
            username: String!
            joinedOn: Datetime!
            birthDay: Date!
        }
    """

    scalars = """
        scalar Datetime
        scalar Date
    """

    schema = make_executable_schema([query, user, scalars])

The order in which types are defined or passed to ``type_defs`` doesn't matter, even if those types depend on each other.


Defining types in multiple modules
----------------------------------

Just like ``type_defs`` can be a string or list of strings, ``resolvers`` can be a single type instance, or a list of instances::

    from ariadne import ObjectType, QueryType, ScalarType

    schema = ... # valid schema definition

    query = QueryType()

    user = ObjectType("User")

    datetime_scalar = ScalarType("Datetime")
    date_scalar = ScalarType("Date")

    schema = make_executable_schema(schema, [query, user, datetime_scalar, date_scalar])

The order in which objects are passed to the ``resolvers`` argument matters. Most objects replace previously bound resolvers with new ones, when more than one is defined for the same GraphQL type, with ``InterfaceType`` and fallback resolvers being exceptions to this rule.
