Ariadne
=======

Ariadne is a Python library for implementing `GraphQL <http://graphql.github.io/>`_ servers.

It presents a simple, easy-to-learn and extend API, with a declaratory approach to type definition that uses a standard `Schema Definition Language <https://graphql.github.io/learn/schema/>`_ shared between GraphQL tools, production-ready WSGI middleware, simple dev server for local experiments and an awesome GraphQL Playground for exploring your APIs.


Features
--------

- Simple, quick to learn and easy to memorize API.
- Compatibility with GraphQL.js version 14.0.2.
- Queries, mutations and input types.
- Asynchronous resolvers and query execution.
- Subscriptions.
- Custom scalars and enums.
- Unions and interfaces.
- Defining schema using SDL strings.
- Loading schema from ``.graphql`` files.
- WSGI middleware for implementing GraphQL in existing sites.
- Opt-in automatic resolvers mapping between `camelCase` and ``snake_case``.
- Build-in simple synchronous dev server for quick GraphQL experimentation and GraphQL Playground.
- Support for `Apollo GraphQL extension for Visual Studio Code <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=apollographql.vscode-apollo>`_.
- GraphQL syntax validation via ``gql()`` helper function. Also provides colorization if Apollo GraphQL extension is installed.
